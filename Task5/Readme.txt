##Important##

The CSV file is extracted for each region and has conical extraction but lacks background subtraction and 
correction for channel jumps!

To make PahFit work with JWST I have made few changes.
Even though it is well commented in the code, please make sure your pahfit has complete file
packages in instrument and science folder. I encourage you get the lattest version or I will include the 
classic package here. We can make changes to classic file add lines remove out of range things
and change its script in our own way keeping the code uniform. I have added few lines and removed
out of range features while I was looking at H2 lines. We can add all the lines that we will be able to see
lets wait for that as I am working on that or if Becca sends that first we can use those! 

Final thing if you fail to locate the package of pahfit, please try to find directory inside miniconda/packages or 
similar to this with whatever python package and envirnment you are using, you can replace the classic file 
that i have uploaded here and make changes as required!
